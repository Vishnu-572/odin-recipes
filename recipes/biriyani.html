        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p><strong>Biriyani</strong> is a mixed rice dish originating among
        the Muslims of the Indian subcontinent. It is made
        with Indian spices, rice, and usually some type of 
        meat, and sometimes, in addition, eggs and potatoes. 
        Biryani is one of the most popular dishes in South Asia, 
        as well as among the <em>diaspora</em> from the region.</p>

          <li>4 chicken breast</li>
          <li>Juice of 1 lemon</li>
          <li>2 tsp garam masala</li>
          <li>1 tsp chilli powder</li>
          <li>1 tsp salt</li>
          <li>300g basmati rice</li>
          <li>1 garlic clove crushed</li>

          <li>850 ml hot chicken stock</li>
          <li>3 tbsp chopped fresh corriander</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat the oil in a large saucepan over a 
                low heat. Add the onion, cover and cook 
                for 10 minutes until softened.</li>
            <li>Cut the chicken into bite-size pieces, 
                tip into a bowl, and add the lemon juice, 
                garam masala, chilli powder and salt. 
                Stir well to coat.</li>
            <li>Rinse the rice several times in cold water, 
                until the water runs clear. Add the garlic 
                and ginger to the onion and cook for 2 
                minutes, then add the chicken pieces and 
                cook for a further 2 minutes, stirring 
                constantly.</li>
            <li>Add the rice and hot stock to the pan, 
                stir well then bring to the boil. Cover 
                with a tight-fitting lid, reduce the 
                heat slightly and cook for 5 minutes. 
                Turn off the heat and leave the pan 
                for 10 minutes to allow the rice to 
                finish cooking in the steam. Do not 
                remove the lid. Stir through the 
                coriander and serve immediately.</li>
